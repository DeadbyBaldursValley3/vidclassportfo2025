# Penny's Video Production Portfolio 2025

I'm a student at Skyline High School. I'm a freshman intrigued by storytelling and it's different mediums, so taking a video production class would definitely help explore those mediums. I like to think I'm good at scriptwriting and storyboarding. I would also like to learn more about editing, setting up shots, and even more.
